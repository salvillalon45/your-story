							One of the most important things that I learned is
							the power of reflection
						</p>
						<p>
							By reflecting I can see everything I have done and
							be proud of myself!
						</p>
						<p>
							At the same time it helps me see what are my next
							steps and see where to invest my time in{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							I started doing this in college and reflecting
							helped me out so much! It serve as a guide to know
							what to do in college! I created this app so that
							others can see the power of reflection and help them
							on their journeys
						</p>
						<p>
							Here a reflection consists of the year and the
							events that happened that year. You will be able to
							add reflections and view them in a nice timeline to
							see what your life has looked like. You can make
							edits to your reflections as well.
						</p>
						<p>
							Hope you enjoy the app. Let me know if you have any
							questions or comments
						</p>
						<p>
							Sincerely, <br />
							Salvador Villalon
